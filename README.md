# Papers

This repo contains code and analysis for academic papers that I have contributed analysis for.

Source data may or may not be included, depending on the nature of the study. Simulation data may or may not be included (depending on the size of the files), but can be built from the included scripts. The repo is organised into a series of subfolders, listed by year, journal, and title. Further information on the reference can be found in the relevant subfolder.

# Papers

This repository houses statistical code for published work where I was the primary analyst. It is provided in order increase transparency about the underlying methodology and lower the barrier to replication. It may also be educational.

Real patient data is not included. *Simulation* data may or may not be included (depending on the size of the files), but can always be built from the included scripts.

The repository is organised into a series of subfolders, each containing the standalone code for each paper. Work under review may be visible under a working title. Articles in-print are listed by year, journal, and title, with the full reference available in the relevant subfolder.
